# To-Do App

This is a simple and functional To-Do App developed using React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and MongoDB. The app allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently by adding, editing, deleting, and marking tasks as completed in a clean and responsive interface.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The To-Do App demonstrates full-stack development skills, combining a responsive frontend with a connected backend using MongoDB. It highlights my ability to create user-friendly interfaces, manage application state, and persist data using modern tools and frameworks.

## ‚úÖ Features

Task Management: Add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed.

Data Persistence: All tasks are stored and retrieved from a MongoDB database using a full RESTful API.

Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

State Management: Managed with React hooks like useState and useEffect.

Dynamic Styling: Designed with Tailwind CSS for a clean and modern look.

Type Safety: TypeScript is used throughout the codebase for reliability.

API Routes (Next.js): Implemented using App Router and dynamic routes for handling CRUD operations.


## üß© Components

TaskApp

The main component of the application includes:

Input Form: For adding and editing tasks.

Task List: Displays all tasks dynamically from the database.

Actions: Edit, delete, and toggle completion status of each task.


## üîß Key Hooks & Methods

useState: For managing task input, task list, and edit mode.

useEffect: To fetch tasks on page load and refresh task list after actions.

fetch API: Used to communicate with Next.js API routes (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
